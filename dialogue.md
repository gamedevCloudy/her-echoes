## Uncertainty - Player Wakes Up
*The player awakens after the crash, disoriented and vulnerable. The voice offers comfort but remains mysterious.*

<scene>
[S1] Can you hear me? Please, say something...  
[S2] (groans) My head... everything's spinning.  
[S1] Thank god. I thought I lost you.  
[S2] (gasps) Lost me? Who... who are you?  
[S1] Someone who cares. You're hurt, but you're alive.  
[S2] (sighs) I can't remember... what happened to us?
</scene>

## Blame/Conflict - Player Blames Girl  
*Frustration and resentment surface as the player lashes out, revealing deeper relationship wounds.*

<scene>
[S2] This is all your fault! You said you'd be there!  
[S1] (sighs) I tried to warn you about the storm—  
[S2] Just like you tried with everything else? Empty promises!  
[S1] That's not fair... you know I never wanted to hurt you.  
[S2] But you did. Over and over again.  
[S1] (sighs) I know... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
</scene>

## Hope - Radio Girl Guides to Tower  
*A moment of connection and trust as she guides him toward safety, echoing better times.*

<scene>
[S1] There's a tower to the north. Can you see it?  
[S2] (exhales) Barely... I don't think I can make it.  
[S1] Remember when we climbed Mount Hood? You didn't give up then.  
[S2] (chuckle) You carried my backpack the whole way.  
[S1] And I'd do it again. Just take it one step at a time.  
[S2] Okay... for us.
</scene>

## Mystery/Exploration - Finding Clues  
*Discovering objects triggers memories, but something feels wrong about the conversation.*

<scene>
[S1] Do you remember our first date by the lake?  
[S2] Yeah... you brought rope for the tire swing.  
[S1] You were so scared of the water back then.  
[S2] (clears throat) Back then? What do you mean 'back then'?  
[S1] I... I just meant—  
[S2] Are you really there? Where are you calling from?
</scene>

## Urgency - Get Back from Pond  
*Panic sets in as reality starts to fracture, the voice becoming more desperate.*

<scene>
[S1] You need to leave! Now! Something's wrong!  
[S2] (gasps) What are you talking about? What's happening?  
[S1] The water... it's rising! Get to higher ground!  
[S2] (inhales) I don't see any water rising—  
[S1] Just run! Please, I can't lose you again!  
[S2] Again? What do you mean again?!
</scene>

## Finish - Radio Revelation  
*The devastating truth emerges as the player realizes the voice was never real.*

<scene>
[S2] (gasps) Wait... I don't have a radio. I never had one.  
[S1] I know...  
[S2] You're not real. You're in my head.  
[S1] (sighs) I never made it to the hospital that day...  
[S2] (gasps) No... no, this can't be happening!  
[S2] (screams) I killed you! I KILLED YOU!
</scene>

## Character Background
**S1 (Radio Voice):** The girlfriend who died in a car accident on the way to reconcile with the player. She exists only in his guilt-ridden mind, manifesting as both comfort and torment.

**S2 (Player):** A man consumed by guilt over his girlfriend's death, projecting his unresolved feelings through hallucinated radio conversations. The crash forces him to confront the truth he's been avoiding.

## Dual Nature Notes
- Each conversation operates on two levels: the survival situation and the relationship conflict
- S1's responses hint at being a memory/ghost rather than a real person
- S2's increasing confusion reflects his fractured mental state
- The rope and anchor symbolize both survival tools and the weight of guilt he carries
